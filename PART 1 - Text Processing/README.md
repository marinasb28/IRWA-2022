This document contains detailed instructions on how to execute the code and choose the various functions and/or other choices to run the code.

This code has to be downloaded and imported in any python-supported platform, since it was created using Google Colaboratory, as a reference, together with the file to be analyzed “tw_hurricane_data.json” and the file with the documents id “tweet_document_ids_map.csv” which will be used for the mapping.

The main cell shows the code for the processing of the data to tweets taking into account the fields and the necessary information.
Then, we make a comparison of 5 processed and unprocessed tweets to check the correctness of the results.

In the cell above, we map the tweets with the ids of the documents. 

No code modification is necessary, just execute the cells in order.
